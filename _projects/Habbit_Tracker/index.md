title: Habit Tracker
description: A Python-based desktop application designed to help users build consistency by tracking their daily habits. It allows easy habit creation, deletion, and visualization of weekly and monthly progress through dynamic line graphs. This project was developed as a personal productivity tool and showcases my skills in data handling, UI design, and performance tracking logic. While the current version is fully functional and used daily, it is still a work in progress and new features are planned for future updates.

### Introduction
This project began as a way to deepen my understanding of Python and apply the knowledge I acquired through an online Udemy course. It uses JSON files to store data and relies on the Tkinter library to build a simple and functional graphical user interface. The current version was developed using a sequential programming approach. To organize and plan the project, I used PyCharm as the development environment, Zenkit for task tracking, and tools like Canva and Paint to create flowcharts and layout diagrams. In future versions, I plan to refactor the code using object-oriented programming and include data visualizations to better track long-term progress.
