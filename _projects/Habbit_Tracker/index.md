title: Habit Tracker
description: A Python-based desktop application designed to help users build consistency by tracking their daily habits. It allows easy habit creation, deletion, and visualization of weekly and monthly progress through dynamic line graphs. This project was developed as a personal productivity tool and showcases my skills in data handling, UI design, and performance tracking logic. While the current version is fully functional and used daily, it is still a work in progress and new features are planned for future updates.
